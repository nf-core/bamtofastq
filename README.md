## Introduction

This pipeline converts (un)mapped `.bam` files into `fq.gz` files.
Initially, it auto-detects, whether the input file contains single-end or paired-end reads. Following this step, the reads are sorted using `samtools collate` and extracted with `samtools fastq`. Furthermore, for mapped bam files it is possible to only convert reads mapping to a specific region or chromosome. The obtained FastQ files can then be used to further process with other pipelines.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Quick Start

i. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)

ii. Install one of [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) or [`conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)

iii. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command

```bash
nextflow run qbic-pipelines/bamtofastq -profile test,<docker/singularity/conda>
```

iv. Start running your own analysis!

```bash
nextflow run qbic-pipelines/bamtofastq -profile <docker/singularity/conda> --input '*.bam'
```

See [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.
